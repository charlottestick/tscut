# tscut
A windows clipboard manager based on Jumpcut & Flycut

## Usage
Press control-alt-v to open up the clipboard, use left & right or up & down to navigate through your clipboard history, then hit enter to paste the selected clipping or escape to close the window without pasting.

## Installing
Go to the Releases section and download the tscut-x.x.x-Setup.exe file from the latest release (this will have the release's version instead of x.x.x)

Once this has downloaded, run the setup file. It may need to be scanned by your anti-virus software and could show an error while this is happening, this error can be dismissed and won't affect the installation.
